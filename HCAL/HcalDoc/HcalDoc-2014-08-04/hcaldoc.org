***** This report covers \alert{Mon., July 28 - Mon., August 4}
***** MWGR from \alert{Wed., July 30 - Fri., August 1}
**** Issues affecting MWGR:
***** Flaky CAEN adaptor on \texttt{ttc-hcal}
***** Lights on for TOTEM
***** S-link errors for DCC 723 (HF)
***** SLB idle in crate 10
**** Issues not affecting MWGR:

* Issues affecting MWGR
** Issues affecting MWGR
*** Lights on for TOTEM: Wed. morning
**** e-logs: [[http://cmsonline.cern.ch/cms-elog/820730][\alert{820730}]], [[http://cmsonline.cern.ch/cms-elog/820859][\alert{820859}]]
**** Symptoms:
***** Usual effects on HF data quality when lights are on
**** Solution:
***** \alert{This intervention will continue for O(weeks)!}
***** We have called TOTEM and asked them to notify us and turn off lights when possible
*** Flakey CAEN adaptor on \texttt{ttc-hcal}: Wed. night
**** e-logs: [[http://cmsonline.cern.ch/cms-elog/820848][\alert{820848}]], [[http://cmsonline.cern.ch/cms-elog/820858][\alert{820858}]]
**** Symptoms:
***** HCAL fails to configure multiple times in global.
***** Chainsaw reads: \texttt{Applications ttc::TTCciControl:4 configuration timed out}
***** Handsaw logs read: \texttt{ERROR TTCXDAQBase::actionPerformed for event type 'ItemRetrieveEvent', item 'StrobeCounter' failed: Caught exception: BusAdapterException 'Could not read from CAEN BusAdapter'}
**** Solution (temporary): reboot \texttt{ttc-hcal}
**** Solution (long-term): under investigation
*** SLINKs errors for DCC 723 (HF): Wed. night
**** e-logs: [[http://cmsonline.cern.ch/cms-elog/820865][\alert{820865}]], [[http://cmsonline.cern.ch/cms-elog/820839][\alert{820839}]]
**** Symptoms:
***** HCAL fails to configure
***** cDAQ errors read: \texttt{Failed to prepare SLINKs} for 723
***** Seating for SLINK cable is OK on both DCC and FRL
**** Solution (temporary): remove FED 723 from global run
**** Solution (long-term): Not obvious.  Under investigation by cDAQ.
***** cDAQ expert is on vacation.
***** \alert{FED 723 will be out of global for O(weeks)!}
*** SLB idle in Crate 10: Fri. morning
**** e-logs: [[http://cmsonline.cern.ch/cms-elog/821232][\alert{821232}]], [[http://cmsonline.cern.ch/cms-elog/821244][\alert{821244}]], [[http://cmsonline.cern.ch/cms-elog/821365][\alert{821365}]]
**** Symptoms:
***** RCT complains of BC0 and phase errors, all from HCAL crate 10
***** No SLB errors in MonVis, but all SLBs from crate 10 are idle
**** Solution (?):
***** Dick observes that RJ-45 cable from the HCAL Master TTCf was not well plugged into crate 10 TTCf.  Reseated.
***** Waiting to hear if this solves the problem.
* Issues not affecting MWGR
** Issues not affecting MWGR
*** Investigation of CCM for HFM08: Wed. morning
**** e-log: [[http://cmsonline.cern.ch/cms-elog/820724][\alert{820724}]]
**** Symptoms:
***** ADCs in current HFM08 CCM do not work
***** After replacing the CCM, HFM08 won't configure
**** Solution:
***** Put original CCM (bad ADCs) back into HFM08
***** Further investigation required
*** Work on new laser: Wed.
**** e-log: [[http://cmsonline.cern.ch/cms-elog/820902][\alert{820902}]]
**** German refilled laser with premix gas 
(output 0.5 mJ/pulse $\rightarrow \text{ } \sim 7$ mJ/pulse)
**** Updated PCI driver and laser software to fix bug with internal triggers
**** Fixed swap of PMT and RADDAM fibers in HFM
**** Now: no light arriving on HFRADDAM fiber on the horizontal near side of HFM
***** Need to open splitter box to understand
***** Other fibers OK
* Conclusion
** Conclusion
*** Conclusion
**** Generally pretty smooth
***** HCAL included in global for [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/commissioning/5208.html][\alert{more runs}]] than any other subsystem (other than HLT and L1, of course)
**** HCAL interrupted the global run twice this week:
***** Failed to configure due to CAEN adaptor on \texttt{ttc-hcal}
***** SLINK errors on FED 723
**** HCAL affected RCT once this week:
***** Possibly due to poorly seated cable on crate 10
**** Two long-term issues \alert{O(weeks)} to consider:
***** TOTEM work means lights sometimes are on for HF
***** cDAQ investigation means FED 723 excluded from global
