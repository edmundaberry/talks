* Introduction
** Introduction
*** Introduction
**** Changes between the Run 1 and Run 2 physics environments are well-documented
**** HCAL has implemented hardware upgrades in response
**** Software updates must:
***** Account for hardware changes (e.g. recalibration)
***** Respond to physics changes in Run 2 environment
*** HCAL hardware upgrades during LS1
**** HB and HE:
***** Replaced clock, control, monitor modules 
***** \alert{Removes synchronization problems with isolated sections of HB and HE}
**** HO
***** Changed hybrid photodiodes to silicon photomultipliers
***** \alert{Improves signal to noise for MIPs in HO}
**** HF
***** Replaced single-anode photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) with thin window multi-anode PMTs
***** Also: installed new cables capable of dual readout
***** \alert{Reduces fake signal from PMT window hits}
*** HCAL software responses

* Calibration
** Introduction to calibration
*** Calibration scope and priorities
**** Tuning and development (\alert{now - end 2014})
***** Address HCAL shortcomings revealed during Run 1
***** Tune existing Run 1 methods for Run 2 environment
***** Develop new methods when necessary
**** Preparing HCAL pre-calibration, (\alert{end 2014, 2 months})
Relying on:
***** Radioactive source calibration: critical for HF startup calibration
***** Cosmics: very effective tool for HO calibration
***** Splashes: useful in 2009 and 2010 for HBHE, not essential in 2015
**** Integration of HCAL tools with AlCa (\alert{\texttt{CMSSW\_7\_3\_X}})
***** \alert{If necessary}
*** Calibration outline
**** Three main areas of focus:                                     :B_block:

1. Radiation damage correction
2. \phi symmetry calibration 
3. Absolute energy calibration:
   * HB & part of HE: single particle (IsoTracks)
   * HE (& perhaps elsewhere): dijet, $\gamma$-jet
   * HF: $Z\rightarrow ee$
   * HO: muons (GeV/MIP sets the scale)

**** More data needed to establish effect beyond stat. fluct.
**** Since HB only has 1 depth (unlike HE with 2-3 depths), layer-dependent damage can only be corrected on average, introducing an energy dependence
**** Effect can probably be removed by MC corrections.
*** Radiation damage: what to do about it
**** Current plan for HE:
***** Use updated laser measurement algo. and updated laser
***** Use pp data as a less-frequent cross-check
***** First year of Run 2: expect signal loss similar to Run 1
**** Current plan for HB:
***** Data suggests layer-dependent radiation damage at 5\%
***** More data needed to establish effect beyond stat. fluct.
***** Continue Co-60 sourcing campaign on HB (\alert{Friday})
***** 4 additional HB wedges to be sourced
**** Correct 2015 data at all levels (L1, HLT, Offline)
** \phi symmetry calibration
*** \phi symmetry calibration
**** Goal: equalize response in \phi for \eta-rings with 2 methods:
**** Method of moments
***** Non-zero-suppressed and non-HCAL triggers
***** Worse precision in the HB than iterative method
***** $\sim5$ million events yields $\sim2\%$ precision
**** Iterative method
***** non-HCAL physics triggers
***** Better precision in the HB than moments method
***** 60 million events yields: 1% HB; 0.2-2.5% HE; 0.3% HF
**** Work on both methods is ongoing for Run 2 environment
** Absolute energy calibration
*** Absolute HB/HE energy calibration: single particle
**** Method for calibration with isolated tracks
**** Tracker provides precision momentum measurement
**** Require:
***** Good quality tracks reaching ECAL and HCAL
***** Tracks are isolated w.r.t. ECAL energy and other tracks
**** Preparing estimates on precision for Run 2 environment
**** No IsoTrack trigger coverage in high $\eta$ HE region
*** Absolute HE energy scale: dijet balancing
**** Method for ring-by-ring calibration with dijet events
**** Building on work done by JP Chou ([[https://indico.cern.ch/event/75820/session/0/contribution/9/material/slides/0.pdf][\underline{\alert{talk}}]], [[http://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/jsp/openfile.jsp?type=IN&year=2008&files=IN2008_046.pdf][\underline{\alert{IN2008/046}}]])
**** Require:
***** Two PFJets with small $|\Delta \eta|$: i.e. two PFJets in the same part of the jet energy response curve
***** Remove PU using PFJets
****** Need to disambiguate energy corrections
****** Working with PF experts
*** Absolute HF energy scale: $Z\rightarrow ee$

* Reconstruction
** Introduction to reconstruction
*** Reconstruction scope and priorities
**** Primary goal is to develop an algorithm for OOT PU mitigation in 25 ns running (\alert{now})
***** A baseline algorithm is ready for \texttt{CMSSW\_7\_2\_0}
***** Fine-tuning is ongoing
***** Improvements could go into \texttt{CMSSW\_7\_3\_0} (\alert{Nov. 10})
**** Develop alternative algorithms (until \alert{Dec. 2014})
**** If we have more than one working algorithm, make a choice for data taking

**** Still in development stage, but manpower is present
**** Regular status updates in HCAL reconstruction working group
* Noise filters
** Introduction to noise filters
*** Noise filters scope and priorities
**** Noise filters that worked in Run 1 need to be updated for the Run 2 environment
**** These updates are under development, and the results are encouraging
