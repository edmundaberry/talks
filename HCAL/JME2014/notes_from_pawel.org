* Email Jordan and Ted Kolberg:
** Roughly how long will it take to collect these events?
** Assume 1 KHz: 5000 seconds?  What's the plan from the operations side?
* Regarding radiation damage:
** What do we know:
*** HE:
**** Run 1 [O(20 fb-1)], we had unexpectedly large damage in HE
***** L1, $\eta$ = 3.0: 30% loss of signal
***** L1, $\eta$ = 2.4: 5% loss of signal
**** In the first year of Run 2, we are anticipating similar loss in HE
**** Plan to maintain calibration of HE
**** Calibration will be applied at all stages of data processing (L1, HLT, prompt reco)
*** HF:
**** Dominant problem in HF in 2011-2012 was loss of PMT gain
***** We hope that problem is gone with replacement PMTs
**** Next biggest problem could be damage to quartz fibers (few % for integrated dose from Run 1)
***** Small effect which we also can correct for
*** HB
**** Preliminary information suggests layer-dependent (flat with $\eta$) radiation damage representing 5%
**** Because this is a single readout (layers are summed to form a tower), can only correct on average
**** Small effect now
** Because we see this non-trivial effect
*** We're spending time to quantify with sourcing
*** Starting this Friday
* Names for radiation damage studies:
** Dima Vishnevskiy (Rochester)
** Robert Ciesielski (Rochester)
** Vladimir Espteyn (ITEP)
